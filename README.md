# ChipRogue
ChipRogue (working title) is a tile-based roguelite game in early development. It can be accessed [here](https://adamluhring.github.io/ChipRogue.html), with controls listed on the same page.
## Roadmap
Plans include:
- Combat system largely consisting of quickly/tactically switching loadouts
- More common enemies and a few bosses
- Procedural generation of levels for several biomes
- More interactive level elements
- Quality of life improvements (journal to look up meaning of observed symbols, improvements to loadout-modding UI)
- Regular and special endings
